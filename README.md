# Health-Lab

This project contains the Health-Lab codebase.

## Installing Dependencies

Health-Lab uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Install Poetry and then run the following command to install all required packages:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will install the main dependencies (`fastapi`, `pydantic`) along with development tools for running tests (`pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`).
