## **Outcome**

*Scalp-hair care* is now a first-class **domain** inside the unified Health-Lab stack:

* Shared **auth, storage, CI/CD, observability** with beard & skin modules.
* Domain-specific **blackout rules (24 h)** enforced centrally.
* Single PDF **weekly / quarterly report** with beard, skin, scalp sections.
* Deterministic **burn-rate automation** keeps consumables stocked and costs predictable (≈ $1 740 yr).
* End-to-end data lineage (Timescale → MLflow → Pandoc) lets you publish peer-review-grade single-subject time-series for scalp density, shedding, sebum, and redness.

Maintain ≥ 90 % adherence, keep cartridges single-use, and your integrated dataset will decisively test whether this multi-modal scalp protocol yields the planned **≥ +5 % Hair-Mass Index at 9 months** while dovetailing with beard and skin regimens.
