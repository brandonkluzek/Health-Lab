## Outcome

The **Facial-Skin module** is now a first-class **`domain="skin"`** inside your Health-Lab platform:

* **Clinical layer** – minimalist but evidence-rich routine (cleanse, Vit-C, TAAN, SPF, barrier guard) with blackout synchronised to scalp microneedling.
* **Operational layer** – automated inventory & adherence checks across all domains.
* **Data layer** – unified TimescaleDB hypertables, shared analytics, 6-month power to detect ≥ 20 % acne reduction.
* **Dev-Ops layer** – single IaC state, single CI/CD, TLS 1.3, S3 Object-Lock, cross-region backups.

With ≥ 90 % adherence you will generate a publication-ready, inter-domain dataset revealing how skin-barrier metrics interact with scalp and beard interventions—while keeping operational overhead minimal.
