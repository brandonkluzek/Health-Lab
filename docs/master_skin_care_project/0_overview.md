# MASTER SKIN-CARE PROJECT — *Facial-Skin* Domain Module

**Version r2 – 21 Jun 2025**
*This specification converts the stand-alone Skin-Care v r1 protocol into a fully namespaced **`domain="skin"`** module inside the unified **Health-Lab monorepo** (which already hosts the “beard” and “scalp” domains).  All tables, event names, blackout windows, Lambda guards, React screens and Grafana panels align 1-for-1 with the merged architecture.*
